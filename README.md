A binary classifier trained to predict if the parents of a student went to college, we are using a public data set called "Goes to College" the link of the dataset is in the end of the readme if you want to check out. I'm using LinearSVG and using the last 200 rows (20% of the file) for testing, i was able to get 85% precision with 86.8% recall
